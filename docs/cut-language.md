# The Cut language

A Cut project is a `.cut` text document. Every change to it is an edit
script in the same vocabulary. People, agents, and version control all read
the same file. The full vocabulary of properties, effects, transitions, and
generators is generated from the catalog:

```bash
cargo run -p cut-lang --example reference
```

```

- `retired=` on the `project` line lists ids of deleted items. Ids are never
  reused, so an edit cannot claim one and generated ids skip them.
- One line is one thing; two-space indentation nests tracks in sequences,
  clips in tracks, and `set`/`fx` lines in clips. `#` starts a comment.
- A clip's content is exactly one of `media=`, `seq=` (a nested sequence),
  `gen=` (a generator such as `title`), or `caption=`.
- `set` holds intrinsic properties (position, scale, crop, opacity, gain, …)
  and generator parameters. `fx` lines are the effect stack, top to bottom.
- Clips sharing a `link=` group, such as a picture and its sound, edit
  together.
- Printing is deterministic and omits defaults. Printing with annotations
  appends comments with each clip's end and source out; parsing ignores them.

### Times

- **Positions** (`at=`, `start=`, markers) are timecode on the sequence,
  `HH:MM:SS:FF`, or `HH:MM:SS;FF` for drop-frame 29.97 and 59.94.
- **Source positions** (`src=`, `out=`) are timecode on the media.
- **Durations** (`dur=`) count frames in the same `HH:MM:SS:FF` shape.
- Anywhere a time is read, `96f` and `4.5s` also work as offsets from the
  start. Seconds round to the nearest frame.
- Keyframe times are relative to the clip: `{0f:0 12f:1:ease}`.

Internally every time is an exact integer of flicks (1/705,600,000 s), so
23.976, 29.97 DF, and 48 kHz audio never drift.

## Scripts

```text
insert media=m1 src=14:22:50:00 dur=00:00:04:00 at=01:00:06:12 on=V1,A1 as=c9,a9
trim c9 out -6f
roll c1 +12f
set c9 opacity={0f:0 12f:1}
fx c9 add color.basic exposure=0.3
transition add from=c1 to=c9 fx=dissolve dur=12f
```

- Lines run in order and atomically: if any line fails, nothing changes, and
  the error names the line and column.
- Later lines see what earlier lines did, so `as=` names let a script refer to
  the clips it creates.
- `insert` opens time on every unlocked track and `overwrite` replaces what
  is underneath. `on=V1,A1` places a picture and its sound as linked clips;
  `out=` gives a source out point instead of `dur=`.
- `ripple-delete`, `extract`, and ripple trims keep every unlocked track in
  sync, and refuse when they would cut through another track's clip. Lock a
  track to leave it out.
- `trim`, `roll`, `slide`, and `move` accept either an amount (`+12f`) or an
  absolute `to=`/`at=` position.
- With several sequences, `use s2` selects the one later lines act on.

Every operation prints back as script (`print_op`, `print_ops`), so history,
UI actions, and agent edits share one readable log.

## In `cutd`

`cutd` keeps the project as `project.cut`, written after every change. Edits
arrive as scripts (`apply_script`), typed operations from the editor
(`apply_ops`, frame counts on the sequence), or v2 commands from older
clients. Each change is journaled as the script it ran, and undo restores
the project as it was. Agent edits stay pending proposals that show the
script and a diff of the document; `get_document` returns the document,
optionally annotated. Render jobs and proposal previews hand renderers the
document with media paths resolved against the project.

## Importing v2 projects

`cut_interchange::v2::import_json` converts a v1 or v2 `project.cut.json`:

- Times snap to the project frame grid.
- Overlapping clips with a v2 transition become a cut at the overlap's
  center, and the overlap becomes handles.
- A picture clip's embedded sound moves to a linked clip on a new audio track.
- Captions become a subtitle track.
- Anything without an equivalent is listed in the warnings.
